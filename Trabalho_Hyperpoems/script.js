        When those blue eyes set like stars,<br> \
        Leaving us to outer darkness.<br> \
        O the longing and the aching!<br> \
        O the sere deserted grave!<br> \

        Let the grass turn brown upon thee,<br> \
        Brown and withered like our dreams!<br> \
        Let the wind moan through the pine-trees<br> \
        With a dreary, dirge-like whistle,<br> \
        Sweep the dead leaves on its bosom,—<br> \
        Moaning, sobbing through the branches,<br> \
        Where the summer laughed so gayly.<br> \

    <p> \
        He is gone, our boy of summer,—<br> \
        Gone the light of his blue eyes,<br> \
        Gone the tender heart and manly,<br> \
        Gone the dreams and the aspirings,—<br> \
        Nothing but the mound remaineth,<br> \
        And the aching in our bosoms,<br> \
        Ever aching, ever throbbing:<br> \
        Who shall bring it unto rest?<br> \
